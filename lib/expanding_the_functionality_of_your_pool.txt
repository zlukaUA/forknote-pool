Hello.

introduction:
I found a convenient pool for mining https://krb.miner.rocks/
it is based on the cryptonote-forknote-pool v1.1.4 code but they have been modified.

1. their code section of the website I downloaded myself.
http://krb.pool.ualinux.com/ROCK/
(
config.js
var api = "https://krb.miner.rocks/api";
)
but (!)
I assume they have remade the code of the pool itself and the API of their pool gives much more information
https://krb.miner.rocks/api/stats

so their website does not work with the API that returns your pool
(
config.js
var api = "http://krb.pool.ualinux.com:8117";
)
and the following result is obtained
http://krb.pool.ualinux.com/ROCK2/


question:
Could you develop a code for your pool so that its API could return more information?

P.S.
code website
http://krb.pool.ualinux.com/ROCK/
I am happy to give you, and you will just add it to your project

my mail: main@ualinux.com

Thank you. I will wait for an answer.
